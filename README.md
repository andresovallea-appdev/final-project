# Final Project

This is a blank Rails application to use as a starting point for your project.

Fork it to your own account, set up a Cloud9 workspace as usual, `bin/setup`, Run Project, and code away!

Some things to remember:

 - If you domain model your idea thoroughly using the firstdraft Ideas tool, the Show Tutorial button at the bottom of the ERD will give you a _lot_ of help when it comes to generating your tables and adding your business logic to your models.
 - This project already includes the ActiveAdmin gem, so you can navigate to `/admin` for a quick-and-dirty way to CRUD records. You can sign in initially with username: `admin@example.com`, password: `password` — don't forget to change these!
 - The Web Git gem is included — keep `/git` open in a tab and *Always Be Committing!*
 - I usually find it a helpful exercise to write some loops in `lib/tasks/dummy.rake` to populate my tables with some dummy data to look at while I am developing my queries and interface. You could also use the admin dashboard at `/admin` and do it manually.
